# Antagonism 

### Problem domain
Hate speech is defined as any sort of spoken, written, or behavioral communication that attacks or utilizes disparaging or discriminating terminology towards a person or group because of who they are, such as their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, ancestry, sex, or any identification factor.

### Current solution proposal
Developing a web application that will be able to classify if the input message is of type ‘hate’ or ‘not’. Moreover, the areas where the level of hate was detected from the input message will be highlighted. 

### A Usecase
When there are large volumes of emails which needs to be sent with in a company/organization, reviewing all of them will be challenging and this is where Antagonism kicks in. Moreover, this can be used anywhere related to do with reviewing text/speech for any such event etc...

### Business view
All users are able to sign up and log in to the application, 5 reviews will be given as free of charge, charges will be made onwards if requests exceed more than 5.
